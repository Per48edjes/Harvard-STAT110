# Harvard STAT 110

This repo houses my self-study artifacts from Harvard's [STAT 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) (as taught by Joe Blitzstein) including strategic practice problems, homework, miscellaneous study aids, associated code, and exams/exam prep work.

**Note**: These PDFs are relatively large and will likely not render correctly (or at all) via Github. For best results, download a copy of each PDF and open locally.

## Schedule

The original intent was to complete the entirety of the course in 2020, which was a goal that was not wholly realized (but I'll count 8 of 11 PSETs as a "W"!).

### Summer 2021 Update 

I renewed my focus on this work after quitting my job, having found a new one, and getting tired of being in a depressive rut ðŸ¥². It took me some time to get back into the swing of things, but I finished the 9th and 10th PSETs in June 2021 and the last PSET in July 2021.

Two remaining tasks remain:

- [ ] Review (and compile summary notes) for Final
- [ ] Take practice Finals and Final
