# Harvard STAT 110

This repo houses my self-study artifacts from Harvard's [STAT 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) (as taught by Joe Blitzstein) including strategic practice problems, homework, miscellaneous study aids, associated code, and exams/exam prep work.

**Note**: These PDFs are relatively large and will likely not render correctly (or at all) via Github. For best results, download a copy of each PDF and open locally.

(This repo and README will be updated soon.)
